(for people that Cant Even Freakin Read)

The method people at my school use to unblock websites, because they're "smart". Only on ChromeOS. (beware, this method is VERY EASY and is intended for SLOW PEOPLE)




## How to use:

1. [Visit This Site: chrome://chrome-signin](chrome://chrome-signin)
2. Click "OK", then in the account sign-in area, type in "google@d11.org".
3. Complete the CAPTCHA.
4. When it takes you to the Microsoft Sign-In page, click on "Sign-In Options".
5. Click "Sign in with GitHub".
6. Scroll down to "Docs".
7. Once in the GitHub Docs, scroll to the bottom and click on "Pricing".
8. In the search bar, enter Google.
9. On the right, click on the "Google.com" link.
10. You're in! See how easy that was? :)


## In case you're stupid and don't know where the "google.com" link is...
